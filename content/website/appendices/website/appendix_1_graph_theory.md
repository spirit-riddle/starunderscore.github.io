## Terminology

### Fundamental Concepts
- **Graph**: A collection of nodes (vertices) and edges connecting them, used to represent relationships and structures.
- **Directed Graph (Digraph)**: A graph where edges have a direction, often used in web page link analysis.
- **Undirected Graph**: A graph where edges have no direction, representing bidirectional relationships.

### Key Properties
- **Node (Vertex)**: A fundamental unit of a graph, representing entities such as web pages or data points.
- **Edge**: A connection between two nodes, which can be directed or undirected.
- **Degree**:
  - **In-Degree**: Number of edges coming into a node.
  - **Out-Degree**: Number of edges leaving a node.
- **Weighted Graph**: A graph where edges have weights representing costs, distances, or probabilities.

### Graph Algorithms
- **Graph Traversal**:
  - **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Explores as far as possible along a branch before backtracking.
  - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores all nodes at the current level before moving deeper.
- **Shortest Path**:
  - **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Finds the shortest path in a weighted graph.
  - **A* Algorithm**: Optimized pathfinding using heuristics.
- **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**:
  - **Prim's Algorithm**: Builds an MST by starting from a node and adding the smallest edge.
  - **Kruskal's Algorithm**: Builds an MST by sorting edges and adding them incrementally.

### Advanced Concepts
- **Adjacency Matrix**: A square matrix used to represent a graph, where each element indicates the presence or absence of an edge.

- **Graph Traversal for Indexing**: Techniques like BFS and DFS are used to crawl and index web pages.
- **Weighted Graphs for Ranking**: Models relationships between pages and computes relevance scores based on link weights.

### Visualization
- **Graph Plotting**: Visualizing nodes and edges to understand relationships and structures.
