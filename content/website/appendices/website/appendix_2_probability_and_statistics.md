# Probability and Statistics

Probability and Statistics are the pillars of data-driven decision-making. They allow us to measure uncertainty, model randomness, and draw meaningful insights from complex datasets. Whether you're predicting outcomes, analyzing trends, or optimizing processes, a solid foundation in these fields is essential.

This packet covers fundamental principles, advanced techniques, and their applications in areas like machine learning, risk analysis, and information retrieval.

## Terminology

### Basic Probability
- **Probability**: A measure of the likelihood that an event will occur, ranging from 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain).
- **Independent Events**: Two events where the occurrence of one does not affect the other.
- **Conditional Probability**: The probability of one event occurring given that another event has already occurred.
- **Bayes' Theorem**: A formula that relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events, used in Bayesian inference.

### Distributions
- **Normal Distribution**: A continuous probability distribution that is symmetric around the mean, forming a bell-shaped curve. Used in many natural phenomena.
- **Binomial Distribution**: Describes the number of successes in a fixed number of binary (yes/no) trials.
- **Poisson Distribution**: Models the number of events occurring within a fixed interval of time or space.

### Expectation and Variance
- **Expectation (Mean)**: The average value of a random variable over many trials.
- **Variance**: Measures the spread of a random variable around its mean.
- **Standard Deviation**: The square root of the variance, representing the average distance from the mean.

### Bayesian Inference
- **Bayesian Inference**: A method of statistical inference in which Bayes' theorem is used to update probabilities as more evidence becomes available.
- **Prior Probability**: The initial probability of an event before new evidence is considered.
- **Posterior Probability**: The updated probability of an event after considering new evidence.

### Hypothesis Testing
- **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: A statement that there is no effect or no difference, used as a baseline in statistical testing.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: A statement that contradicts the null hypothesis, suggesting an effect or difference.
- **P-Value**: The probability of obtaining results at least as extreme as the observed results, assuming the null hypothesis is true.
- **Confidence Interval**: A range of values that is likely to contain the true value of an unknown parameter.

### Regression Analysis
- **Linear Regression**: A method to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
- **Logistic Regression**: Used to model binary outcomes (e.g., true/false, yes/no).

### Information Gain
- **Entropy**: A measure of the uncertainty or randomness in a set of data.
- **Mutual Information**: Measures the reduction in uncertainty about one variable given knowledge of another.

### Markov Models
- **Markov Chain**: A stochastic model describing a sequence of possible events where the probability of each event depends only on the state of the previous event.
- **Transition Matrix**: A matrix that represents probabilities of transitioning from one state to another in a Markov chain.

### Random Variables
- **Random Variable**: A variable whose value is subject to randomness, often categorized as discrete or continuous.
- **Probability Density Function (PDF)**: Describes the likelihood of a continuous random variable taking on a specific value.
- **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)**: Describes the probability that a random variable is less than or equal to a certain value.

### Sampling and Estimation
- **Sampling**: Selecting a subset of data from a population for analysis.
- **Bias**: A systematic error introduced into sampling or estimation.
- **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)**: A method of estimating the parameters of a statistical model by maximizing the likelihood function.

### Correlation and Dependence
- **Correlation Coefficient**: A measure of the linear relationship between two variables, ranging from -1 to 1.
- **Covariance**: A measure of how two random variables vary together.

### Statistical Models in Search
- **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**: A statistical measure used to evaluate the importance of a word in a document relative to a corpus.
- **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)**: A probabilistic model used for topic modeling in text analysis.

This list captures the essential probability and statistics concepts that underpin ranking algorithms and web search relevance models.
