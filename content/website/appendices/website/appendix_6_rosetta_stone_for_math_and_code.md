## Set Theory

| Symbol     | Name                 | Meaning                                 | Example             |
|------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------|
| $\in$      | Element of           | Indicates membership in a set           | $x \in S$           |
| $\notin$   | Not an element of    | Indicates non-membership in a set       | $x \notin S$        |

| $\cup$     | Union                | Combines all elements from two sets     | $A \cup B$          |
| $\cap$     | Intersection         | Identifies elements common to two sets  | $A \cap B$          |


### **$\in$ ("Element of")**

**Mathematical Syntax**  
The symbol **$\in$** ("element of") indicates that a specific element belongs to a set. It is fundamental in logic and set theory, where it describes membership relationships. In programming, this is similar to checking for the presence of an item within a collection or data structure.

---

**Example in Logic**  
**$x \in S$**:  
*"The element \( x \) belongs to the set \( S \)."*

---

**Key**  
- **$\in$**: Represents "element of," meaning the item belongs to a set.  
- **\( x \)**: A variable representing an individual element.  
- **\( S \)**: The set of all items being considered.  

---

**Practical Application**  
*"Each term in the search query is an element of the vocabulary set used to index documents. This ensures that only known terms contribute to the ranking algorithm."*

---

**Code Example**

```python
# Function to check if an element x exists in a set S
def is_element_of(S, x):
    return x in S  # Python's 'in' operator checks for membership

# Example usage:
vocabulary = {"search", "engine", "ranking", "algorithm"}  # Set S: vocabulary terms
term = "engine"  # Element x
result = is_element_of(vocabulary, term)

print(f"'{term}' is in the vocabulary:", result)  # Output: 'engine' is in the vocabulary: True
```

---


### **$\notin$ ("Not an element of")**

**Mathematical Syntax**  
The symbol **$\notin$** represents logical **non-membership**. It asserts that a specific element does **not** belong to a given set.  

---

**Example in Logic**  
**$x \notin S$**:  
*"The element \( x \) does not belong to the set \( S \)."*

---

**Key**  
- **$\notin$**: Represents "not an element of," meaning the item is absent from the set.  
- **\( x \)**: A variable representing an individual element.  
- **\( S \)**: The set being evaluated.  

---

**Practical Application**  
*"In spam filters, an email is flagged if it contains terms that are **not an element** of a pre-approved vocabulary list."*

---

**Code Example**

```python
# Function to check if an element x does not exist in a set S
def is_not_element_of(S, x):
    return x not in S  # Python's 'not in' operator checks for non-membership

# Example usage:
approved_terms = {"offer", "discount", "sale"}  # Set S: approved vocabulary
term = "lottery"  # Element x
result = is_not_element_of(approved_terms, term)

print(f"'{term}' is not in the approved terms:", result)  # Output: 'lottery' is not in the approved terms: True
```

---

### **$\subseteq$ ("Subset")**

**Mathematical Syntax**  
The symbol **$\subseteq$** represents the concept of a **subset**. It asserts that all elements of one set are also elements of another set, meaning one set is contained within the other.  

---

**Example in Logic**  
**$A \subseteq B$**:  
*"The set \( A \) is a subset of \( B \), meaning every element of \( A \) is also an element of \( B \)."*

---

**Key**  
- **$\subseteq$**: Subset symbol.  
- **\( A, B \)**: Sets being compared.  
- **Result**: True if all elements of \( A \) are also in \( B \); otherwise, False.  

---

**Practical Application**  
*"In search engines, a document is flagged as relevant if the set of user query terms is a subset of the document’s keywords."*

---

**Code Example**

```python
# Function to check if one set is a subset of another
def is_subset(set_a, set_b):
    return set_a <= set_b  # Use Python's '<=' operator for subset comparison

# Example usage:
query_terms = {"graph", "optimization"}  # Set A: user query terms
keywords = {"algorithm", "data", "graph", "optimization"}  # Set B: document keywords

result = is_subset(query_terms, keywords)

print("Query terms are a subset of keywords:", result)  # Output: True
```

---

**Example Breakdown**  

Given two sets:  
- **Set A** = {graph, optimization}  
- **Set B** = {algorithm, data, graph, optimization}  

The subset **$A \subseteq B$** evaluates to **True**, as all elements of \( A \) are found in \( B \).  

---

**Visualization**  

To better understand the concept, consider the following **Venn Diagram**:

```
         _________
        |         |  
        |    B    |  
        |  ______  |  
        | |   A  | |  
        | -------- |  
         ---------  
```

The smaller circle represents \( A \), fully contained within the larger circle \( B \), demonstrating that \( A \subseteq B \).  

---







### **$\cup$ ("Union")**

**Mathematical Syntax**  
The symbol **$\cup$** represents the **union** of two sets. It combines all the elements from both sets, removing duplicates to ensure each element appears only once.  

---

**Example in Logic**  
**$A \cup B$**:  
*"The union of \( A \) and \( B \) contains all elements in \( A \), in \( B \), or in both."*

---

**Key**  
- **$\cup$**: Represents "union," combining elements of two sets.  
- **\( A, B \)**: Sets being combined.  

---

**Practical Application**  
*"In search systems, combining results from two separate queries forms a union of documents that match either query."*

---

**Code Example**

```python
# Function to compute the union of two sets
def union_sets(A, B):
    return A.union(B)  # Python's 'union' method combines two sets

# Example usage:
A = {1, 2, 3}  # Set A
B = {3, 4, 5}  # Set B

result = union_sets(A, B)

print(f"The union of A and B is:", result)  # Output: The union of A and B is: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

---

### **$\cap$ ("Intersection")**

**Mathematical Syntax**  
The symbol **$\cap$** represents the **intersection** of two sets. It identifies the elements that are **common** to both sets.  

---

**Example in Logic**  
**$A \cap B$**:  
*"The intersection of \( A \) and \( B \) contains all elements that are in both \( A \) and \( B \)."*

---

**Key**  
- **$\cap$**: Intersection symbol.  
- **\( A, B \)**: Two sets being compared.  
- **Result**: A new set containing elements common to both \( A \) and \( B \).  

---

**Practical Application**  
*"In search engines, the intersection of user query terms and document keywords determines the most relevant search results."*

---

**Code Example**

```python
# Function to calculate the intersection of two sets
def intersection(set_a, set_b):
    return set_a & set_b  # Use Python's '&' operator to find common elements

# Example usage:
keywords = {"algorithm", "data", "graph", "optimization"}  # Set A: document keywords
query_terms = {"graph", "search", "optimization"}          # Set B: user query terms

common_terms = intersection(keywords, query_terms)

print("Common terms:", common_terms)  # Output: {'graph', 'optimization'}
```

---

**Example Breakdown**  

Given two sets:  
- **Set A** = {algorithm, data, graph, optimization}  
- **Set B** = {graph, search, optimization}  

The intersection **$A \cap B$** results in:  
**{graph, optimization}**.  

This represents the terms that appear in both sets, improving the relevance of results.  

---

**Visualization**  

To better understand the concept, consider the following **Venn Diagram**:

```
         _________
        |         |  
        |   A     |  
        |   ∩     |  
        |    B    |  
         ---------  
```

The shaded area in the middle represents the intersection \( A \cap B \), where elements are shared between the two sets.

def exists(S, P):
    return any(P(x) for x in S)  # Python's any() checks if any element satisfies P

# Example usage:
transactions = [200, 150, 300, 100]  # Set of transaction amounts
threshold = 250  # Threshold value
condition = lambda x: x > threshold

result = exists(transactions, condition)

print("There exists a transaction exceeding the threshold:", result)  # Output: True
```

    if n == 0:  # Special case: 0! = 1
        return 1
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):  # Multiply all integers from 1 to n
        result *= i
    return result

# Example usage:
n = 5
result = factorial(n)

print(f"The factorial of {n} is:", result)  # Output: The factorial of 5 is: 120
```

---

**Example Breakdown**  

Let \( n = 4 \):  
**$n! = 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 24$**  

Step-by-step:  
1. \( 4 \times 3 = 12 \)  
2. \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \)  
3. \( 24 \times 1 = 24 \)  

Final result: \( 4! = 24 \).  

---

**Visualization**  

To visualize, think of factorials as a way to count arrangements:  
- **$3!$**: Arrange 3 items: \{A, B, C\} → ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA  
- Total arrangements = 6 = **$3!$**  

```  
   A → B → C  
   A → C → B  
   B → A → C  
   B → C → A  
   C → A → B  
   C → B → A  
```

```python
# Function to calculate the summation of integers from 1 to n
def summation(n):
    return sum(range(1, n + 1))  # Python's sum() and range()

# Example usage:
n = 5  # Upper limit
result = summation(n)

print(f"The summation from 1 to {n} is:", result)  # Output: The summation from 1 to 5 is: 15
```

---

**Example Breakdown**  

Let \( n = 4 \):  
**$\Sigma_{i=1}^4 i = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10$**

Step-by-step:  
1. \( 1 + 2 = 3 \)  
2. \( 3 + 3 = 6 \)  
3. \( 6 + 4 = 10 \)  

Final result: \( \Sigma_{i=1}^4 i = 10 \).  

---

**Visualization**  

Imagine summing consecutive numbers:  
- \( 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 \): Start at 1, add each next number until you reach 4.  
- This operation is compactly represented by the **$\Sigma$** notation.  

```  
   1 → 2 → 3 → 4  
   Total = 10  
```

**Example Breakdown**  

Let \( n = 3 \):  
**$\Pi_{i=1}^3 i = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 = 6$**

Step-by-step:  
1. \( 1 \times 2 = 2 \)  
2. \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \)  

Final result: \( \Pi_{i=1}^3 i = 6 \).  

---

**Visualization**  

Think of the product operation as repeated multiplication:  
- \( 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \): Start at 1, multiply each next number until you reach 4.  
- This operation is compactly represented by the **$\Pi$** notation.  

```  
   1 → 2 → 3 → 4  
   Total = 24

## Probability and Statistics

| Symbol   | Name                 | Meaning                                            | Example           |
|----------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| $P(A)$   | Probability of A     | The likelihood of event \( A \) occurring         | $P(A) = 0.5$      |
| $E(X)$   | Expected Value       | The weighted average of possible values of \( X \)| $E(X) = 3.5$      |
| $\sigma^2$ | Variance           | The measure of dispersion around the mean         | $\sigma^2 = 2.92$ |

### **$P(A)$ ("Probability of A")**

**Mathematical Syntax**  
The symbol **$P(A)$** represents the **probability** of an event \( A \). It quantifies the likelihood that the event will occur, expressed as a value between 0 (impossible) and 1 (certain).

---

**Example in Logic**  
**$P(A) = 0.5$**:  
*"The probability of \( A \) occurring is 50%."*  

For example:  
- Flipping a fair coin and getting heads: \( P(\text{Heads}) = 0.5 \).

---

**Key**  
- **$P$**: Probability function.  
- **$A$**: Event of interest.  
- **$P(A)$**: Value between 0 and 1, where:  
  - \( P(A) = 0 \): \( A \) is impossible.  
  - \( P(A) = 1 \): \( A \) is certain.  

---

**Practical Application**  
*"In weather forecasting, \( P(A) \) represents the probability of rain on a given day, helping people plan their activities."*

---

**Code Example**

```python
# Function to calculate probability (example for a fair coin)
def probability_of_event(event_outcomes, total_outcomes):
    return event_outcomes / total_outcomes  # Probability formula: favorable / total

# Example usage:
favorable_outcomes = 1  # Getting heads
total_outcomes = 2      # Heads and tails

P_heads = probability_of_event(favorable_outcomes, total_outcomes)

print(f"The probability of getting heads is:", P_heads)  # Output: 0.5
```

---

**Visualization**  

Imagine a simple experiment like flipping a coin:  
- Outcomes: Heads, Tails  
- \( P(\text{Heads}) = \frac{1}{2} \), \( P(\text{Tails}) = \frac{1}{2} \).  

In a pie chart:  
- Each outcome occupies half the circle, representing equal probability.

```  
   Heads → 50%  
   Tails → 50%  
```

---

### **$E(X)$ ("Expected Value")**

**Mathematical Syntax**  
The symbol **$E(X)$** represents the **expected value** (or mean) of a random variable \( X \). It provides a measure of the central tendency of a probability distribution, calculated as the weighted average of all possible values of \( X \), where the weights are the probabilities of each value.

---

**Formula**  
**$E(X) = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i P(x_i)$**:  
*"The expected value of \( X \) is the sum of each possible value \( x_i \) of \( X \), multiplied by its probability \( P(x_i) \)."*

For example:  
- Rolling a fair six-sided die, \( E(X) = \frac{1}{6}(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) = 3.5 \).

---

**Key**  
- **$E(X)$**: Expected value of the random variable \( X \).  
- **$x_i$**: A possible value of \( X \).  
- **$P(x_i)$**: Probability of \( x_i \) occurring.  

---

**Practical Application**  
*"Expected value is used in finance to calculate the average return on an investment, considering the probabilities of different outcomes."*

---

**Code Example**

```python
# Function to calculate the expected value of a discrete random variable
def expected_value(values, probabilities):
    return sum(v * p for v, p in zip(values, probabilities))  # Weighted average

# Example usage:
values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  # Possible values of a six-sided die
probabilities = [1/6] * 6     # Equal probability for each outcome

E_X = expected_value(values, probabilities)

print(f"The expected value is:", E_X)  # Output: 3.5
```

---

**Visualization**  

Consider a weighted bar chart representing the outcomes of a die roll:  
- X-axis: Values (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)  
- Y-axis: Probabilities (\( \frac{1}{6} \) for each value)  

The expected value \( E(X) \) is the weighted center of the distribution, balancing all probabilities.

---

### **$\sigma^2$ ("Variance")**

**Mathematical Syntax**  
The symbol **$\sigma^2$** represents the **variance** of a random variable \( X \). Variance measures the spread or dispersion of a probability distribution, indicating how much the values of \( X \) deviate from the expected value \( E(X) \).

---

**Formula**  
**$\sigma^2 = E[(X - E(X))^2]$**:  
*"Variance is the expected value of the squared differences between \( X \) and its mean \( E(X) \)."*

Alternatively, for discrete random variables:  
**$\sigma^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n P(x_i) (x_i - E(X))^2$**

---

**Key**  
- **$\sigma^2$**: Variance of \( X \).  
- **$X$**: Random variable.  
- **$E(X)$**: Expected value (mean) of \( X \).  
- **$P(x_i)$**: Probability of each outcome \( x_i \).  

---

**Practical Application**  
*"Variance is used in finance to measure the risk of an investment by quantifying the fluctuation in returns."*

---

**Code Example**

```python
# Function to calculate the variance of a discrete random variable
def variance(values, probabilities):
    mean = sum(v * p for v, p in zip(values, probabilities))  # Expected value
    return sum(p * (v - mean) ** 2 for v, p in zip(values, probabilities))  # Variance formula

# Example usage:
values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  # Possible values of a six-sided die
probabilities = [1/6] * 6     # Equal probability for each outcome

variance_X = variance(values, probabilities)

print(f"The variance is:", variance_X)  # Output: 2.9166666666666665
```

---

**Example Breakdown**  

For a six-sided die:  
1. Expected value \( E(X) = 3.5 \).  
2. Variance:  
   **$\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{6}((1 - 3.5)^2 + (2 - 3.5)^2 + \dots + (6 - 3.5)^2)$**  
   **$\sigma^2 = 2.92$ (approx.)**

---

**Visualization**  

Variance can be visualized as the spread of a distribution around its mean:  
- A smaller variance means values are tightly clustered around the mean.  
- A larger variance indicates values are more spread out.

---

a, b = 0, 1         # Bounds of integration
result = integral(f, a, b)

print(f"The integral of f(x) from {a} to {b} is approximately:", result)
# Output: The integral of f(x) from 0 to 1 is approximately: 0.333333...
```

---

For \( \int_0^1 x^2 \, dx \):  
1. Divide the interval \([0, 1]\) into smaller subintervals.  
2. Approximate the area under \( x^2 \) within each subinterval.  
3. Sum all areas to find the total.

---

print(f"Manhattan norm (L1): {manhattan_norm}")    # Output: 7.0
print(f"Maximum norm (L-infinity): {max_norm}")    # Output: 4.0
```

**Example Breakdown**  

For \( x = (3, 4) \):  
1. **Euclidean Norm (\( L_2 \))**:  
   **$\|x\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{25} = 5$**  
2. **Manhattan Norm (\( L_1 \))**:  
   **$\|x\|_1 = |3| + |4| = 7$**  
3. **Maximum Norm (\( L_\infty \))**:  
   **$\|x\|_\infty = \max(|3|, |4|) = 4$**

---

Imagine \( x = (3, 4) \) as a vector in 2D space:  
- The **Euclidean norm** measures the straight-line distance from the origin to \( (3, 4) \).  
- The **Manhattan norm** measures the distance along a grid (like city blocks).  
- The **Maximum norm** measures the largest absolute component.  

```  
   y
   |       *
   |     /

Imagine a matrix as a grid of numbers:  

```  
A = [ 1  2 ]  
    [ 3  4 ]  
```  

- Each entry corresponds to a value in the matrix.

---

### **$A^T$ ("Transpose of A")**

**Mathematical Syntax**  
The symbol **$A^T$** represents the **transpose** of a matrix \( A \). Transposing a matrix involves flipping its rows and columns, effectively interchanging the element at position \( (i, j) \) with the element at \( (j, i) \).

---

**Example in Logic**  
If \( A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{bmatrix} \):  
**$A^T = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 \\ 2 & 4 \end{bmatrix}$**

---

**Key**  
- **$A$**: Original matrix.  
- **$A^T$**: Transposed matrix.

print("Transpose of A:\n", A_transpose)
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
Matrix A:
 [[1 2]
  [3 4]]
Transpose of A:
 [[1 3]
  [2 4]]
```

---

**Example Breakdown**  

Given \( A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{bmatrix} \):  
1. Swap rows and columns:  
   - Row 1 (\( 1, 2 \)) → Column 1 (\( 1, 3 \)).  
   - Row 2 (\( 3, 4 \)) → Column 2 (\( 2, 4 \)).

If \( A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 3 \end{bmatrix} \),  
then \( \lambda = 2, 3 \) are eigenvalues of \( A \), because there exist nonzero vectors \( \vec{v} \) such that \( A \vec{v} = \lambda \vec{v} \).

---

**Key**  
- **$A$**: Square matrix.  
- **$\lambda$**: Eigenvalue, a scalar that scales the eigenvector.  
- **$\vec{v}$**: Eigenvector associated with \( \lambda \).  

---

**Practical Application**  
*"Eigenvalues are used in various fields such as physics, engineering, and data science to analyze stability, vibrations, principal components, and other phenomena."*

---

**Code Example**

```python
# Calculate eigenvalues using NumPy
import numpy as np

# Define a square matrix
A = np.array([[2, 0], [0, 3]])

# Compute eigenvalues
eigenvalues, _ = np.linalg.eig(A)

print("Eigenvalues of A:", eigenvalues)
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
Eigenvalues of A: [2. 3.]
```

---

**Example Breakdown**  

Given \( A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 3 \end{bmatrix} \):  
1. Solve \( A \vec{v} = \lambda \vec{v} \).  
2. Find \( \lambda \) such that \( \det(A - \lambda I) = 0 \):  
   - \( \det\begin{bmatrix} 2 - \lambda & 0 \\ 0 & 3 - \lambda \end{bmatrix} = (2 - \lambda)(3 - \lambda) = 0 \).  
   - Solutions: \( \lambda = 2, 3 \).

---

**Visualization**  

Eigenvalues describe how a matrix scales its eigenvectors:  
- For \( A \vec{v} = \lambda \vec{v} \):  
   - The matrix \( A \) stretches or compresses \( \vec{v} \) by a factor of \( \lambda \).  

---

### **$u, v$ ("Eigenvectors")**

**Mathematical Syntax**  
The symbols **$u$** and **$v$** often represent **eigenvectors** in linear algebra. Eigenvectors are nonzero vectors associated with a square matrix \( A \) and a scalar \( \lambda \) (eigenvalue) such that:

**$A \vec{v} = \lambda \vec{v}$**

Here, \( \vec{v} \) is an eigenvector of \( A \), and \( \lambda \) is the corresponding eigenvalue. Eigenvectors define directions that remain unchanged under the transformation represented by \( A \), though they may be scaled by \( \lambda \).

---

**Example in Logic**  
If \( A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 3 \end{bmatrix} \),  
then the eigenvectors of \( A \) correspond to the standard basis vectors \( \vec{e}_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \) and \( \vec{e}_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \) with eigenvalues \( \lambda = 2, 3 \).

---

**Key**  
- **$u, v$**: Common notation for eigenvectors.  
- **$\lambda$**: Eigenvalue associated with each eigenvector.  
- **$A$**: Square matrix.  

---

**Practical Application**  
*"Eigenvectors are used in principal component analysis (PCA) to identify directions of maximum variance in datasets, reducing dimensionality while preserving important information."*

---

**Code Example**

```python
# Calculate eigenvectors using NumPy
import numpy as np

# Define a square matrix
A = np.array([[2, 0], [0, 3]])

# Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors
eigenvalues, eigenvectors = np.linalg.eig(A)

print("Eigenvectors of A:")
print(eigenvectors)
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
Eigenvectors of A:
[[1. 0.]
 [0. 1.]]
```

---

**Example Breakdown**  

For \( A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 3 \end{bmatrix} \):  
1. Solve \( A \vec{v} = \lambda \vec{v} \).  
2. Using eigenvalues \( \lambda = 2, 3 \), find eigenvectors \( \vec{v} \):  
   - For \( \lambda = 2 \): Eigenvector \( \vec{v}_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \).  
   - For \( \lambda = 3 \): Eigenvector \( \vec{v}_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \).

---

**Visualization**  

Eigenvectors define invariant directions for a transformation \( A \):  
- If you apply \( A \) to \( \vec{v} \), the vector points in the same direction but is scaled by \( \lambda \).  
- In 2D space, eigenvectors are visualized as arrows along these invariant directions.

### **Graph and Matrix Notation**

| Symbol      | Name               | Meaning                                          | Example              |
|-------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| $A[i][j]$   | Adjacency Matrix   | Represents connections between graph nodes       | $A[i][j] = 1$ if $i \to j$, otherwise $0$ |
| $|V|, |E|$  | Cardinality        | Number of vertices (\( |V| \)) and edges (\( |E| \)) in a graph | $|V| = 3, |E| = 3$  |

---

### **$A[i][j]$ ("Adjacency Matrix")**

**Mathematical Syntax**  
The notation **$A[i][j]$** represents an **adjacency matrix**, which encodes the structure of a graph. Each element \( A[i][j] \) indicates whether there is an edge from node \( i \) to node \( j \).  
- **$A[i][j] = 1$**: There is an edge from \( i \) to \( j \).  
- **$A[i][j] = 0$**: There is no edge from \( i \) to \( j \).  

---

**Example in Logic**  
For a graph with nodes \( \{1, 2, 3\} \):  

- If there is an edge \( 1 \to 2 \), then \( A[1][2] = 1 \).  
- If there is no edge \( 1 \to 3 \), then \( A[1][3] = 0 \).  

The adjacency matrix for this graph:  
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & 1 & 0 \\ 
0 & 0 & 1 \\ 
1 & 0 & 0 
\end{bmatrix}
\]

---

**Key**  
- **$A[i][j]$**: Entry in the matrix indicating the presence of an edge.  
- **Directed Graph**: \( A[i][j] \neq A[j][i] \) in general.  
- **Undirected Graph**: \( A[i][j] = A[j][i] \) for all \( i, j \).  

---

**Practical Application**  
*"Adjacency matrices are widely used in graph theory for tasks such as finding shortest paths, detecting cycles, and representing social or network structures."*

---

**Code Example**

```python
# Representing a graph using an adjacency matrix
import numpy as np

# Define the adjacency matrix
adj_matrix = np.array([
    [0, 1, 0],  # Node 1
    [0, 0, 1],  # Node 2
    [1, 0, 0]   # Node 3
])

# Check if there is an edge from node 1 to node 2
edge_1_to_2 = adj_matrix[0][1] == 1

print(f"Is there an edge from node 1 to node 2? {edge_1_to_2}")
# Output: True
```

---

**Example Breakdown**  

For the adjacency matrix:  
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & 1 & 0 \\ 
0 & 0 & 1 \\ 
1 & 0 & 0 
\end{bmatrix}
\]

- \( A[1][2] = 1 \): There is an edge from node \( 1 \to 2 \).  
- \( A[2][3] = 1 \): There is an edge from node \( 2 \to 3 \).  
- \( A[3][1] = 1 \): There is an edge from node \( 3 \to 1 \).  

---

**Visualization**  

The graph can be visualized as:  
\[
1 \to 2 \to 3 \to 1
\]

```plaintext
    1 → 2
    ↑   ↓
    3 ←
```

The adjacency matrix encodes this structure compactly, facilitating computations and graph analysis.

---

### **$|V|, |E|$ ("Cardinality")**

**Mathematical Syntax**  
The symbols **$|V|$** and **$|E|$** denote the **cardinality** of a graph's vertex set \( V \) and edge set \( E \), respectively.  
- **$|V|$**: Number of vertices (nodes) in the graph.  
- **$|E|$**: Number of edges (connections) in the graph.  

---

**Example in Logic**  
For a graph with:  
- Nodes \( V = \{1, 2, 3\} \),  
- Edges \( E = \{(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1)\} \):  

**$|V| = 3$**, **$|E| = 3$**.  

---

**Key**  
- **$|V|$**: Size of the vertex set \( V \).  
- **$|E|$**: Size of the edge set \( E \).  
- Represents the overall structure and complexity of a graph.  

---

**Practical Application**  
*"Cardinality is used to quantify the size and connectivity of a graph, providing key metrics for analyzing networks, optimizing paths, and understanding relationships between entities."*

---

**Code Example**

```python
# Calculate |V| and |E| for a graph using an adjacency matrix
import numpy as np

# Define the adjacency matrix
adj_matrix = np.array([
    [0, 1, 0],  # Node 1
    [0, 0, 1],  # Node 2
    [1, 0, 0]   # Node 3
])

# Calculate |V| (number of nodes) and |E| (number of edges)
num_vertices = adj_matrix.shape[0]            # Number of rows/columns
num_edges = np.sum(adj_matrix)                # Sum of all edges (1s in the matrix)

print(f"Number of vertices (|V|): {num_vertices}")  # Output: 3
print(f"Number of edges (|E|): {num_edges}")        # Output: 3
```

---

**Example Breakdown**  

Given the graph with:  
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & 1 & 0 \\ 
0 & 0 & 1 \\ 
1 & 0 & 0 
\end{bmatrix}
\]

- **$|V| = 3$**: Number of nodes (1, 2, 3).  
- **$|E| = 3$**: Edges are \( (1 \to 2), (2 \to 3), (3 \to 1) \).  

---

**Visualization**  

The graph can be visualized as:  
\[
1 \to 2 \to 3 \to 1
\]

```plaintext
    1 → 2
    ↑   ↓
    3 ←
```

- \( |V| = 3 \): Nodes 1, 2, 3.  
- \( |E| = 3 \): Edges connecting the nodes.
