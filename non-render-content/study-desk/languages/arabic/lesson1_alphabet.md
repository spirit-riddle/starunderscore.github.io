The Arabic alphabet is unique and versatile, consisting of 28 letters that adapt their shape based on their position in a word. These letters can take on four forms: **isolated** (when the letter stands alone), **initial** (when it starts a word), **medial** (when it occurs in the middle), and **final** (when it ends a word). Understanding these forms is crucial for reading and writing in Arabic, as the visual changes ensure a fluid connection between letters, giving the script its characteristic elegance and readability.
